This repository is a modified fork of [Pagoda](https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda), a full-stack web development starter kit and admin panel in Go. 

Here we are using it as a reference stack that showcases how the **[Edka](https://edka.io)** platform provisions and manages the infrastructure with GitOps, creates preview environments for every pull request and deploys code to production. Use it as a fast-start template or simply explore how everything fits together.

## Key Advantages
- **Cloud freedom, PaaS simplicity** â€“ Provision a hardened Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner in minutes, manage it through a simple UI and Git.
- **Cost Efficiency** â€” Hetzner VMs and storage are often 80â€“90 % cheaper than comparable AWS, Azure, or GCP offerings.
- **Self-Service Deployments** â€” Push to Git, run automated tests, get a preview environment per pull request, merge and ship.
- **Extensible Add-ons** â€” Pick pre-configured add-ons for databases, ingress, observability, CI/CD, and more.
- **Open Standards** â€” Built on CNCF projects like k3s, Flux, cert-manager, CloudNativePG, External Secrets.
