	// This pages helps to illustrate the different options you can take when using HTMX to introduce interactivity
	// to your web application. The following three options are available, but here, we're opting for the first one.
	// 1) Highly-optimized and progressive enhancement:
	//    This is highly-optimized because the server is doing the least amount of work possible, only rendering
	//    the least amount possible based on the incoming request. It's possible that even your route handler would
	//    want to check the HTMX request in order to limit what it does. With HTMX, it's possible to still return a
	//    normal, full page, but use hx-select to pluck out only the part you want to re-render. It requires some extra
	//    condition checks and code but performance is improved. Progressive enhancement refers to having a fully
	//    functional web app, even if JS was disabled, but providing the enhancement if JS is enabled. All of these
	//    examples should continue to work fine without JS.
	// 2) Not optimized and progressive enhancement:
	//    As mentioned previously, you can remove all of these conditions, re-render the entire page for every request,
	//    and rely on HTMX's hx-select to only replace what you want to (ie, the posts).
	// 3) Optimized and partial renderings:
	//    You could have a separate route that is only for fetching posts while paging, and that would render only
	//    that partial HTML, which HTMX would then use to inject in to this page.
